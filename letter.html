    <h1>Dear Nandhitha❤️,</h1>
    <div class="letter-body">

            I know this message might come as a surprise. We’ve never met or spoken, and I’ve only seen your photo. But sometimes, a single moment is enough to change something inside us. That’s what happened to me. When I first saw your picture, I felt something I couldn’t explain — and even though I tried to ignore it and move on, the feeling kept coming back. Quietly, but constantly.

            I didn’t know where to begin, so I thought I’d start with myself. I’m a software engineer by profession, working for the past 8–9 months, and recently I’ve been working as a data analyst here in Bangalore. I’m a certified programmer, and I’ve spent the last few years building my career and supporting my family. That was my only focus — and “It wasn’t that I lacked the courage to meet you — I did. But life, my responsibilities, and timing just kept getting in the way.”

            Over the past 6 months, I’ve silently followed you from a distance — not in a strange way, but out of genuine admiration and respect. I came to know a little about you — your name, your Instagram, and a few details. But I’ve never dared to disturb your world. I just… watched, quietly, and wished.

            Now that I’ve finally found some stability in my life, I realized something: I don’t want to live the next 22 years with a “what if” in my heart. I may not know what the future holds, and I’m not saying we should fall in love instantly…
            But it would be beautiful if we did.

            No matter what happens after this message, I want you to know: I will always respect you. I’m not here to impress you with words — just to share a small truth that’s lived in my heart for months.

            Take your time. If this means nothing to you, I’ll understand. But if you feel even a little curious to know me… I’ll be here.

            <b>I waited. I’m waiting. I will wait — for you 💙...</b>
